# raylib-zig
Manually tweaked, auto generated [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) bindings for zig.<br>
Bindings tested on raylib version 3.0

## Workaround
On this branch I will try to wokraround the [technical restrictions](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig#technical-restrictions) the normal binding has. May cause severe bugs, terms of the [license](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig/blob/master/LICENSE) apply.
